        Hi, I'm Mihir, a second-year master's student in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Data Driven Analysis and Computation at Columbia University. This summer, I'm working as a Quant Researcher at a sports betting platform, focusing on alpha discovery and developing predictive models for sports markets.
        <br /><br />
        My research interests center on Quantitative Finance, Reinforcement Learning and GenAI. I'm passionate about applying AI to financial marketsâ€”developing systematic trading strategies, risk management models, and alternative data analysis pipelines. My coursework in Quantitative Trading, Statistical Learning, and Generative AI has strengthened my foundation in mathematical finance.
          <br /><br />
          During Spring 2025, I serve as AI Lead at a Columbia-based FinAI startup, building a team to develop an automated tax filing system. I'm also conducting research on reinforcement learning applications for portfolio optimization using financial news sentiment.
          <br /><br />
          Previously, I worked as a Software Research Engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems with <Link href="https://binds.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Laurent Bindschaedler</Link>, developing dynamic data pipelines for satellite image augmentation and building LLM-based querying systems.
          <br /><br />
          During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work with <Link href="https://sudeeptanwar.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Sudeep Tanwar</Link> on reinforcement learning algorithms for energy trading systems and electric vehicles, resulting in published research.
          <br /><br />
          My long-term goal is to become a quantitative researcher, leveraging machine learning and statistical methods to develop systematic trading strategies and optimize financial systems at scale.
          <br /><br />
