        Hi, I'm Mihir, a first-year master's student in Electrical Engineering with a focus on AI at Columbia University. I'm currently seeking Summer 2025 internships where I can apply my software engineering and research skills. I'm particularly interested in machine learning applications across various industries, as well as general software engineering and analyst roles.          
        <br /><br />
        My primary research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Control. Through my research, I aim to apply and optimize state-of-the-art algorithms and methods for specific niche areas, creating practical impact. My long-term goal is to work on optimizing large systems, such as trading platforms, leveraging my knowledge in these areas.
          <br /><br />
          Currently, I am working as a Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems with <Link href="https://binds.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Laurent Bindschaedler</Link> on the augmentation of satellite images.
          <br /><br />
          During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work with <Link href="https://sudeeptanwar.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Sudeep Tanwar</Link> on topics including reinforcement learning, energy trading algorithms, and electric vehicles.
          <br /><br />
          If you're interested in my work or would like to discuss any shared technical interests, feel free to get in touch!
